# trump_facts
This project is meant to be a bipartisan, open-source, publicly-available, easily-readable website/repository giving
facts, backed up by sources, about Donald J. Trump. In an age with rapidly changing news stories and emotionally-charged debates, 
it is important to have a detailed, backed-up factual record of someone with the reach and power that Donald Trump has.

Contributions welcome!
